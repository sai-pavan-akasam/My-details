### Hi there! I'm [Sai Pavan Akasam] 👋

I am a **Educator** and **Learner** with a strong engineering foundation, currently transitioning into **Data Engineering**. I bring the precision of Hardware Verification into the world of Big Data.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Advanced Digital System Design research and Data Engineering portfolio projects.
- 🎓 **I’m currently teaching:** Digital Electronics, FPGA Design, and Advanced Digital Systems.
- 💼 **Past Experience:** Design Verification Engineer at Insemi Technology (AMBA, SPI, UART,FIFO).
- 🌱 **I’m learning:** Python for Data Science, SQL, Apache Spark, and Cloud Data Warehousing.
